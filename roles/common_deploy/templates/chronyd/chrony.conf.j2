# The server directive specifies an NTP server which can be used as a time
# source. The client-server relationship is strictly hierarchical: a client
# might synchronise its system time to that of the server, but the serverâ€™s
# system time will never be influenced by that of a client.

# One of the main activities of the chronyd program is to work out the rate at
# which the system clock gains or loses time relative to real time.
# Whenever chronyd computes a new value of the gain or loss rate, it is
# desirable to record it somewhere. This allows chronyd to begin compensating
# the system clock at that rate whenever it is restarted, even before it has had
# a chance to obtain an equally good estimate of the rate during the new run.
# (This process can take many minutes, at least.)# Record the rate at which the
# system clock gains/losses time.

# Normally chronyd will cause the system to gradually correct any time offset,
# by slowing down or speeding up the clock as required. In certain situations,
# the system clock might be so far adrift that this slewing process would take a
# very long time to correct the system clock.
# This directive forces chronyd to step the system clock if the adjustment is
# larger than a threshold value, but only if there were no more clock updates
# since chronyd was started than a specified limit (a negative value can be used
# to disable the limit).

# The rtcsync directive enables a mode where the system time is periodically
# copied to the RTC and chronyd does not try to track its drift. This directive
# cannot be used with the rtcfile directive.
# On Linux, the RTC copy is performed by the kernel every 11 minutes.

# This directive allows the directory where log files are written to be
